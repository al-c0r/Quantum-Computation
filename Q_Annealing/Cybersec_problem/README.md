This is work is reproduction of research paper: https://www.chem.purdue.edu/kais/docs/publications/2021/TrainingAQuantumAnnealing.pdf that I've done on my Major Phase - I under the guidance of Prof. Anil Shaji.
Here we use Q-Annealing to synthesise the datapoints in RBM to balance the dataset.
Finally, we perform binary classification to see how the model performs.
