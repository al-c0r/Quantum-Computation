This work is reproduction of research paper: https://www.chem.purdue.edu/kais/docs/publications/2021/TrainingAQuantumAnnealing.pdf that I've done on my Major Phase - 1 under the guidance of Prof. Anil Shaji (shaji@iisertvm.ac.in).
We use dataset of ISCX IDS 2012 from Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids.html.
Here we use Q-Annealing to synthesise the datapoints in RBM to balance the dataset.
Finally, we perform binary classification to see how the model performs.
