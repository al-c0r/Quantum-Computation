This is the extension of work as part of my Phase-II Major Project that I did earlier using Quantum Annealer where we use Gate-based models to implement a Variational circuit to synthesise the data and further compare their performance.
And to synthesise dataset we need Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM), here the technique to implement QBM is heavily inspired from this research paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42484-020-00033-7
